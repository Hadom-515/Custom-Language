 #simple program which shows mathematical operations.

func main() {
  int a;
  int b;
  int c;

  a = 100;
  b = 50;

  # This should output '150'
  c = a + b;
  prt(c);

  # This should output '50'
  c = a - b;
  prt(c);

  # This should output '5000'
  c = a * b;
  prt(c);

  # This should output '2'
  c = a / b;
  prt(c);

  # This should output '0'
  c = a % b;
  prt(c);

  # Complex Expression. (4 + 2) * 7
  int d;
  a = 4;
  b = 7;
  c = (a + 2) * b;
